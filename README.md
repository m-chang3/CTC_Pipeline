# OHSU-CTC_pipeline
Pipeline to run CTC libraries generated by SMARTseq2 against the hg38 genome verison

# Steps to run the pipeline:
### 1)
Copy the folder hg38_pipeline_fresh/scRNA_SMARTseq2 into a new working directory (above hg38_pipeline_fresh)

### 2)
Symlink samples into the folder samples/raw/ within the scRNA_SMARTseq2 directory. You can use ln -s /path/to/samples/* ./samples/raw (from the scRNA_SMARTseq2 directory)

### 3)
Ensure that the samples are in the proper naming format. Samples must be named with the suffix "_R1.fq.gz"

### 4)
Update the omic_config.yaml file with the Seurat parameters required.

### 5)
Create a conda environment with the package snakemake installed. You can install by creating a new environment, activating it, and running the command "conda install -c bioconda snakemake=4.3.0"
You MUST use Snakemake version 4.3.0!
